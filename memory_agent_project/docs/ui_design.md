UI Design for Streamlit Memory Agent App
This document outlines the conceptual design for the Streamlit-based user interface of the AI agent with long-term memory. The goal is to create a simple, intuitive chat interface that also provides visibility into the agent's memory.

## 1. Overall Layout

The application will have a single-page layout, primarily divided into two main sections:

* **Main Chat Area:** The central and largest part of the screen, where the user interacts with the AI agent.
* **Memory Debug Panel (Sidebar):** A collapsible sidebar or a dedicated section to display the raw memories stored by the agent, primarily for demonstration and debugging purposes.

## 2. Main Chat Area Components

* **Title:** A clear, prominent title at the top, e.g., "AI Memory Assistant."
* **Chat History Display:**
  * A scrollable area that shows the ongoing conversation between the user and the AI.
  * Each message will clearly indicate whether it's from the "User" or the "AI."
  * AI responses will appear after the agent processes the user's input.
  * Styling: Simple, clean bubbles or distinct text colors for user and AI messages for readability.
* **Text Input Field:**
  * A multi-line text area at the bottom of the chat history.
  * A placeholder text, e.g., "Type your message here..."
  * Should automatically clear after the message is sent.
* **Send Button:**
  * A button next to the text input field, labeled "Send" or a paper plane icon.
  * Triggers the submission of the user's message to the AI agent.
* **Loading Indicator:**
  * A visual cue (e.g., "Thinking..." message, spinner) displayed while the AI agent is processing the request.

## 3. Memory Debug Panel (Sidebar/Section)

This section is crucial for demonstrating the memory mechanism.

* **Title:** "Long-Term Memories" or "Agent's Memory Bank."
* **User ID Display:** Clearly show the `user_id` currently active for the memory. This is important for understanding how memories are scoped.
* **Memory List:**
  * A dynamic list that displays the `content` and `context` of all memories currently stored for the active `user_id` in ChromaDB.
  * Each memory entry should be clearly distinguishable.
  * This list should update automatically as new memories are saved by the agent during the conversation.
* **Clear Memories Button:**
  * A button (e.g., "Clear All Memories") to allow the user to reset the memory for the current `user_id` for testing purposes. A warning dialog should precede this action.

## 4. User Flow

1.  User opens the Streamlit application.
2.  User types a message into the input field and clicks "Send" (or presses Enter).
3.  The application displays a loading indicator.
4.  The agent processes the message (potentially using `save_user_memory` or `retrieve_user_memories` tools).
5.  The AI's response appears in the chat history.
6.  If a new memory was saved, the "Long-Term Memories" panel updates to show the new entry.
7.  User can continue the conversation.
8.  User can optionally click "Clear All Memories" to reset the agent's memory for demonstration.

## 5. Styling Considerations

* Keep the design clean and functional. Streamlit's default styling is sufficient for a project demo.
* Ensure good contrast for text.
* Responsive design is less critical for a primary desktop demo, but Streamlit handles basic responsiveness well.

This design ensures that both the conversational aspect and the underlying memory mechanism are clearly visible and understandable to anyone observing the demo.
